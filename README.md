# Bitcoin SHA-256 Hashing in System Verilog

This repository contains the implementation of the **SHA-256 hashing algorithm** and **Bitcoin hashing** using **System Verilog**. SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function that plays a central role in the Bitcoin protocol, where it is used to hash block headers and perform proof-of-work.
